# **AI-Powered Caption Generator**  

 **Overview**  
The **AI-Powered Caption Generator** is a text generation system built using **GPT-2** and **Hugging Face Transformers**, capable of generating **contextually relevant and creative captions** from text prompts. This project explores the potential of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and deep learning in automating content generation, making it useful for **social media, marketing, and creative writing.**  

---

##  **Project Features**  
- Generates **engaging and context-aware captions** from user input.  
- Fine-tuned **GPT-2** using **Hugging Face's Transformers library** for text generation.  
- Utilizes **Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling)** to improve **diversity and coherence** in generated captions.  
- Supports multiple use cases, including **social media automation, storytelling, and marketing copywriting.**  
- User-friendly implementation with a simple input-output interface.

##  **How It Works**  
1. **Preprocessing Data:** The model takes a text prompt as input and processes it using **GPT-2**.  
2. **Generating Captions:** The fine-tuned model generates fluent, **contextually relevant** text outputs.  
3. **Sampling Strategy:** **Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling)** is used instead of standard greedy decoding to ensure more **creative and coherent** text generation.  
4. **Post-processing:** The output is structured to provide a meaningful and engaging caption.

##  **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **GPT-2** (via Hugging Face Transformers)  
- **Hugging Face Transformers Library**  
- **Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling)**  
- **Google Colab** (for model training and experimentation)

##  **Getting Started**  
### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caption-generator.git
cd caption-generator
```  

2. Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets
```  

3. Run the script:  
```bash
python generate_caption.py
```

### **Future Enhancements**  
- Fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets for more context-aware captions.  
- Integrate image-to-caption generation using multimodal AI models.  
- Implement speech-to-text functionality for voice-based caption generation.
